# Local Variables in Terraform

## 📘 Overview

In this module, I explored how to simplify and reuse Terraform configurations using `locals {}`. Local values help reduce redundancy and improve clarity, especially when referencing values multiple times across different resources.

Local variables act as **constants or helper variables** that make complex Terraform code more readable, maintainable, and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## 🧪 What I Tried

I used local variables primarily to:
* **Reference data sources** cleanly (like resource group name and location)
* Avoid repeating hardcoded values across resources
* Pass resource-specific metadata efficiently
* Simplify complex expressions throughout the configuration

### Example Implementation:

```hcl
# Define local variables
locals {
  rg_info = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg
}

# Data source for existing resource group
data "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name = "terraform-rg"
}
```

### Usage Across Resources:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "nsg1" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-nsg1"
  resource_group_name = local.rg_info.name      # ✅ Clean reference
  location            = local.rg_info.location  # ✅ Clean reference
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "nic1" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-nic"
  resource_group_name = local.rg_info.name      # ✅ Reused easily
  location            = local.rg_info.location  # ✅ Reused easily
  
  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "internal"
    subnet_id                     = data.azurerm_subnet.subnet1.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
}
```

## 🧹 Troubleshooting Journey

### ❌ Problem Encountered:
Initially, I tried to reference a local that didn't exist:

```hcl
resource_group_name = local.rg.name
```

**Error Message:**
```
│ Error: Unsupported attribute
│ local.rg doesn't have attribute "name"
```

### ✅ Solution:
I realized I needed to:
1. **Define the local properly** by assigning the full data source object
2. **Reference attributes correctly** through the local variable

**Correct Implementation:**
```hcl
locals {
  rg_info = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg  # Assign full object
}

# Then reference attributes like:
resource_group_name = local.rg_info.name
location            = local.rg_info.location
```

## 🧠 Key Learnings

| Concept | Learning |
|---------|----------|
| **Immutability** | Locals are immutable once declared and can't depend on resources created by Terraform |
| **Best Use Cases** | Perfect for cleaning up repeated expressions, especially long references like `data.azurerm_something.xyz.attribute` |
| **Team Collaboration** | Essential practice when working with teams or refactoring larger Terraform modules |
| **Performance** | Locals are evaluated once and cached, improving plan/apply performance |
| **Scope** | Locals are scoped to the module where they're defined |

### 💡 Benefits of Using Locals

| Benefit | Explanation | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **✅ DRY Principle** | Reduces duplication of common expressions | `local.rg_info.name` vs `data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.name` |
| **✅ Improved Readability** | Makes code cleaner and more understandable | Shorter, meaningful variable names |
| **✅ Easier Refactoring** | Change the local once instead of editing multiple lines | Update one local definition affects all references |
| **✅ Reduced Errors** | Less chance of typos in repeated expressions | Single source of truth for complex values |

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Created

This configuration deploys:
- **Network Security Group** with RDP access rule
- **Network Interface** with dynamic IP allocation
- **Windows Virtual Machine** (Standard_B1s) running Windows Server 2019
- **Subnet association** for the NSG

### Security Note:
⚠️ **The RDP rule allows access from any network (`*`). In production, restrict this to specific IP ranges.**

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── main.tf         # Main configuration with locals usage
├── variables.tf    # Variable definitions
└── README.md       # This documentation
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**Note:** The provided configuration contains sensitive information that should be secured:
- Service Principal credentials should be stored in environment variables or Key Vault
- Admin passwords should use random generation or Key Vault references
- NSG rules should follow principle of least privilege

## 🎯 Syntax Reference

### Basic Locals Syntax:
```hcl
locals {
  variable_name = expression
  another_var   = "static_value"
  computed_var  = "${var.prefix}-${local.variable_name}"
}
```

### Referencing Locals:
```hcl
resource "resource_type" "name" {
  attribute = local.variable_name
}
```
